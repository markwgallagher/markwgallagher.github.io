# Mark W. Gallagher

**Senior Infrastructure, Network & Application Performance Engineer**  
Focused on reliability, observability, and reducing operational friction through pragmatic automation

## About

I design, operate, and improve large-scale networked systems that underpin critical enterprise applications. My background spans enterprise and federal environments, with deep experience in application delivery, traffic management, security controls, and hybrid cloud infrastructure.

Much of my work focuses on understanding how infrastructure and traffic behavior affect application reliability and performance — and then building practical tooling and automation to make those relationships visible and actionable for operators and service owners.

I’m particularly interested in senior or principal-level roles that combine deep technical analysis with architecture, internal tooling, and operational decision-making.

## Featured Work

### OK Network
A lightweight local network visibility tool designed to surface application and service health quickly and honestly.

Features include:
- Hostname discovery using certificate transparency data
- RTT and TLS health checks
- Detection of unreachable services and soon-to-expire certificates

Built to answer the operational question:  
*“What’s actually up right now — and how healthy is it?”*

### Scripts & Utilities
A curated collection of small automation and diagnostic tools used in real operational contexts for:
- Network and application troubleshooting
- Incident response and validation
- Repetitive operational tasks and data extraction

These tools emphasize speed, clarity, and correctness over abstraction.

## Notes on Development Workflow

Code samples favor explicitness, maintainability, and operational usefulness.  
Where AI-assisted tooling is used, it supports analysis, documentation, or workflow efficiency and is paired with manual review and validation.
