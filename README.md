## About

I specialize in diagnosing and improving complex networked systems, with experience across enterprise and federal government environments. My work centers on performance, availability, and building small, effective tools that surface operational truth quickly.

I’m particularly interested in roles that blend deep technical analysis with architecture, tooling, and operational decision-making.

## Notes on Development Workflow

Code samples emphasize clarity, correctness, and maintainability.  
Where AI-assisted tooling (e.g., GitHub Copilot) is used, its role is documented transparently alongside manual review and validation.
